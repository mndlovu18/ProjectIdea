	<h1>PROJECT IDEA:</h1>
    <h2>JAVA GAME</h2>
	<p>I want to build a game that is meant to teach Java to people who are beginners and want to learn the fundamentals of the language. To move on to a higher level the person will need to get a fact about the language right or write the correct snippet of code. I still need to figure the whole thing out and get all the facts right.</p>
	
	<h3>USER PROBLEM</h3>
	<p>Learning to code is very hard for most people especially if they have to start doing it at a later stage in their lives. This game is meant to give the learner a fun way of learning to code.</p>
